### Phase 1 <mark>(WIP)</mark>
-   [x] Create form to gather users business details(generally what you have on a business card and some more like social links)
-   [ ] Display this data in the scene dynamically
---
### Phase 2
- Create personalized "AR Cards" 
    * based on data a card owner has entered, generate unique URL 
    * this can be shared to card holders(existing) to experience the already present business card in AR
- For new card owners, can propose them to integrate a unique QR code generated from this portal
    * this will allow to automatically experience the card in AR when scanned without you having to share anything
